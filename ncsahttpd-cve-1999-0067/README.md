# NCSA-HTTPd `phf` command injection example

This repo replicates finding [CVE-1999-0067] with
[fuzzing](https://forallsecure.com/blog/fuzzing-for-command-injection).

## To build

Assuming you just want to build the docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t forallsecure/ncsahttpd-cve-1999-0067 .
```

## Get from Dockerhub

If you don't want to build locally, you can pull a pre-built image
directly from dockerhub:

```bash
docker pull forallsecure/ncsahttpd-cve-1999-0067
```


## Run under Mayhem

Change to the `ncsahttpd-cve-1999-0067` folder and run:

```bash
mayhem run mayhem/phf
```

and watch Mayhem replicate CVE-1999-0067! It should take very little time
(< 1 minute).

## Run locally

If you want to just run the libfuzzer target locally and you've pulled
the dockerhub image, run:

```
docker run forallsecure/ncsahttpd-cve-1999-0067
```

## POC

We have included a proof of concept output under the `poc`
directory. This bug should be found in around 30 seconds.

Note: Fuzzing has some degree of non-determinism, so when you run
yourself you may not get exactly this file.  This is expected; your
output should still trigger the phf bug.
