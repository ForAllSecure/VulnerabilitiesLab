# Netflix Dial CVE-2019-10028 example

This repo replicates finding [CVE-2019-10028](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10028), a denial of service bug caused by an out of bounds write in a Netflix Dial protocol reference server ([CVSS Score](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss): 7.5).

 We reported this bug responsibly to the maintainers, with the fix implemented [here](https://github.com/Netflix/dial-reference/commit/93756a84eaf31579050da7d9d7f902ee367d6535#diff-93f1e21b10c4a4950b389297eb3168fa).

> Note: since this finds the bug in an unmodified binary
> (a *network target*), it can only be found by fuzzers that support network
> fuzzing (such as [Mayhem](https://www.forallsecure.com/solutions/devsecops/)).

## To build

Assuming you just want to build the docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t forallsecure/netflix-cve-2019-10028 .
```

## Get from Dockerhub

If you don't want to build locally, you can pull a pre-built image
directly from dockerhub:

```bash
docker pull forallsecure/netflix-cve-2019-10028
```


## Run under Mayhem

Change to the `netflix-cve-2019-10028` folder and run:

```bash
mayhem run mayhem/dial
```

and watch Mayhem replicate the bug! This bug takes some time (~6 hours)
to find but be patient!

## Run locally

Since this is a uninstrumented network binary, it is not possible to easily fuzz locally. However, [Mayhem] (https://www.forallsecure.com/solutions/devsecops/) can easily take care of this!

## POC

We have included a proof of concept output under the `poc`
directory.

> Note: Fuzzing has some degree of non-determinism, so when you run
yourself you may not get exactly this file.  This is expected; your
output should still trigger the Netflix dial bug.
