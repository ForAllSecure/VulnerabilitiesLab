%logistDisRand.m - this MATLAB file solves the 
%discrete logistic equation x(i+1)=r*x(i)*(1-x(i)) with a white noise
%and the users is prompted to read in the value
% of r to use as well as the initial value
% x0 which must be in (0,1)
% and the time interval over which to run the 
% simulation.
